# star_filtering

This program was developed by Gor Yeghiazaryan during his internship in the Freedom Astronomy
as a junior Python developer and junior astronomy trainee. This program use the dataset that
contains various information about many stars. The program filters the dataset and selects 
only the columns that it needs in order to perform the calculations. After the filtration
it selects the stars that are in a several field of view, sorts them by their brightness,
calculates their distance from the several point in the sky and sorts them by their calculated 
distances. The ouput is a .csv file which contains the ID,ra,dec,brightness and distance of the stars.
